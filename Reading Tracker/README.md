## Important Note ‚ö†Ô∏è
Although this code can be used, you must create your own Pixela account and create your own token in order to create the graph and personalize it according to your needs, such as:

- the unit
- a color of your choice
- the habit you wish to track

That being said, make sure you also read the APIs documentation before proceeding.

## Documentation üìë

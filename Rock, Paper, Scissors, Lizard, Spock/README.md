# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Created by Sam Kass, and much loved by the character of Sheldon Cooper from the sitcom The Big Bang Theory, this slight variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors reduces the probability of the game ending in a draw by adding two more fun shapes to it: Lizard and Spock.

## Who Beats Who?
First things first, let's learn how to win the game.

If we were to quote Sheldon, we could say that: _Scissors cut Paper, Paper covers Rock, Rock crushes Lizard, Lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes Scissors, Scissors decapitate Lizard, Lizard eats Paper, Paper disproves Rock, Spock vaporizes Rock, and — as it always has — Rock crushes Scissors._

However, to make things simpler, let's put it this way:
- Rock beats Scissors and Lizard.
- Paper beats Rock and Spock.
- Scissors beat Paper and Lizard.
- Lizard beats Paper and Spock.
- Spock beats Rock and Scissors

## How to Play?
1. As soon as you run the code, you'll be asked to choose among Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard and Spock.
2. Once your choice was made, it's the computer's turn to choose an option.
3. The computer will always choose a random option, which means you an either win or lose.
4. In case the computer chooses the same option as you, which could happen, then it will be a draw.
5. If you win, lose or it's a draw, the end result will be shown after the computer makes a choice.

## Example:
```
What do you choose?
Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, 2 for Scissors, 3 for Lizard or 4 for Spock.

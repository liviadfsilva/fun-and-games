# URL Shortener

This is a simple program created to turn those long URLs into tiny little ones, which can be really helpful for when you need to paste them somewhere and would rather it be a short text instead of a three-line one.

<div align="center">   <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b4/e3/71/b4e371619042d1e80918d09904e90f7d.gif" alt="Matrix"> </div>


## How Does It Work?
Once you run the code, you'll be asked to paste the URL you want to shorten as shown below. As soon as the URL is inserted, press 'Enter' and see the magic happen.

Paste your URL here:
```
